        <span>container, the brown-black softness of</span>
        <span>decay. it's raining. how long have you been</span>
        <span>curled around it? does it still look</span>
        <span>like you? funny how time goes one</span>
        <span>way, but water goes where it pleases. here,</span>
        <span>a few windswept drops cling</span>
        <span>to the arm of your sweater. there, a puddle</span>
        <span>crawls up your pant leg. open your</span>
        <span>hands. it left long ago, or you lost it, or you</span>
        <span>put it down yourself. come out from under there.</span>
        <span>nothing is keeping you.</span>
